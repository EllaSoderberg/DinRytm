# Din rytm website
This is the first website I've built myself, for the company of my mother. 
I've used the framework [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the CSS framework [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
I've also used Netlify CMS so that my mother can easily edit the content of the website herself.
To get started I used the starter [Gatsby Starter Tailwind](https://gatsby-starter-tailwind.oddstronaut.com/).
